# text-representation-classifiers

This project applies different key text representation techniques and evaluate their performance using different classifiers.

- A text classifier is built using **Term Frequency** (TF) as text representation & Naive Bayes as the classifier algorithm.
- Another text classifier is built using **TF-IDF** as text representation & Naive Bayes as the classifier algorithm.
- Another text classifier is built using **Convolutional Neural Network** (CNN).
- Another CNN-based text classifier is built using **pre-trained word embeddings** (GloVe).
- Another CNN-based text classifier is built by applying data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning and changing classifiers.

A summary report is displayed to compare the different test accuracies for the different models above.
